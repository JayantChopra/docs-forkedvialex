<Info>
  Polarity is dashboard‑only — there is no API. Make sure the GitHub App is installed so Polarity can analyze your repositories and open PRs automatically.

## Overview page

The Overview page gives you a real‑time snapshot across all connected repositories.

- **Analysis Success Rate**: Percentage of successful analyses vs total attempts. Use this to monitor stability of analyses across repos.
- **Code Improvements**: Count of files improved by Polarity across your repositories.
- **Monthly Credits**: Credits used vs monthly quota. Credits are consumed when Polarity simulates behavior, traces dependencies, and prepares improvements.
- **Active Repositories**: Number of repositories currently enabled for analysis.

Below the KPIs, the **Analysis Activity** chart shows volume over time. Use the range controls to switch between the last 7 days, 30 days, or 3 months.

At the bottom, **Recent Activity** lists the latest PRs and optimization events from Polarity.

<Tip>
  If you see a banner about system load, analyses may take longer. They will resume automatically — no action needed.
